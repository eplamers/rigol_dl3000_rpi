# rigol_dl3000_rpi
code built on pyvisa to run a rigol-dl3000 during battery load testing data collections

The purpose of this code is to use a raspberry pi as the data acquisition system for a rigol-dl3000 load tester. This is intended to help streamline/automate repeated tests that I plan to run with the dl3000. I am focusing on using an RPI as the DAQ, rather than a proper linux/windows laptop because I expect the data collections to take multiple hours - so I don't want to tie down my laptop for extended periods
